    "What are your strengths and weaknesses?|Strengths: I excel at overcoming new challenges and proactively solving problems with efficiency. I am detail-oriented, highly accurate, and well-organized, with strong documentation and communication skills. I take the initiative in breaking down complex problems into actionable steps and always strive for continuous learning. Weaknesses: I tend to take on too much responsibility myself because I want to ensure everything is done precisely. However, I am working on improving my delegation skills and learning to trust others to share responsibilities effectively. I'm not naturally confident in public speaking or presenting ideas to large groups. To address this, I've been practicing by participating in smaller meetings and preparing more thoroughly for presentations. I sometimes feel impatient when progress is slow, especially when I believe a task could be completed more efficiently. However, I've been working on improving my patience by understanding different working styles and focusing on collaboration to maintain a steady pace"
    "Why do you want to work here?|I want to work here because your company's focus aligns with my passion for leveraging data to drive insights and improve decision-making processes. I also value a collaborative and innovative work culture.",

    "What accomplishments are you most proud of?|I am most proud of my ability to innovate and create impactful solutions in environments without established systems. For example: I established Looker Studio dashboards to make data more accessible, even while data was still being manually inputted at that time, I created multiple automation tools that streamlined manual workflows, saving time and improving accuracy. I also introduced data-driven decision-making practices that shifted the company culture towards relying on insights rather than intuition. Seeing my ideas applied and helping others succeed has been incredibly rewarding",
    "Why are you leaving (or why did you leave) your current/previous job?|I left because I felt limited in opportunities for growth and lacked alignment with the work environment. I am seeking a fully remote role to focus on productivity and collaboration.",

    "How do you ensure effective communication in a team?|I ensure effective communication by setting clear expectations, using collaboration tools, and scheduling regular check-ins to stay aligned.",
    "What role do you usually take in a team?|I usually take on the role of a data strategist or problem-solver, ensuring tasks are completed efficiently and with high quality.",
